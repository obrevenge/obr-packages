The Calamares Installer is designed to allow for dual boot setups on your machine; however, there have many problems with installing using Calamares during the GRUB install process when os-prober is present. This issue is being investigated; however, Calamares will not identify and add other systems to your GRUB boot menu during the install process. There is a relatively easy way to solve this, however.

First, boot into OBRevenge OS and make sure that you are connected to the internet.

Second, open a terminal. You will need to know what partition the other system is installed on. For example, if Ubuntu is installed on /dev/sda1, and you installed OBRevenge OS onto /dev/sda2, then you will need to know that Ubuntu is installed on /dev/sda1. If you are not sure, you can check what partitions are on your machine and their mount points with the following command in the terminal:

      lsblk

Third, mount the partition that contains the other operating system using the following command:

      sudo mount <the partition> /mnt

Replace with the partition identifier, such as /dev/sda1 in the above example.

Fourth, install os-prober with the following command:

      sudo pacman -S ob-prober

os-prober is a relatively small package and will not take long to install.

Now, you need to generate a new GRUB configuration file. Use the following command.

      grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

In the output of this command, you should be able to see where os-prober detected your other operating system. You will then need to unmount the partition with the following:

      sudo umount -R /mnt

Finally, reboot the system and ensure that both operating systems are no available in the GRUB menu.

This can also be accomplished by manually editing the GRUB configuration file located at /boot/grub/grub.cfg; however, I find that the above method helps to ensure mistakes are not made on the config file that cause the system to fail to boot.
